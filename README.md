## üîπ Part I: Quantum Cryptanalysis

This part investigates how future quantum computers could threaten RSA, ECC, and symmetric cryptography by using algorithms like **Shor‚Äôs** and **Grover‚Äôs**. We also explore qubit scaling projections (Rose‚Äôs Law) and resource estimation using Q#.

---

### 1. Grover‚Äôs Algorithm vs Classical Search

We tested the asymptotic complexity of Grover‚Äôs algorithm compared to brute-force key search.

- **Asymptotic operations:**  
  ![Grover asymptotic ops](reports/grover_asymptotic_ops.png)

- **Illustrative runtime scaling:**  
  ![Grover asymptotic time](reports/grover_asymptotic_time.png)

**Explanation:**  
Classical brute force requires \(O(2^n)\) operations, while Grover reduces this to \(O(2^{n/2})\).  
The plots show that Grover‚Äôs advantage grows as key sizes increase (e.g., AES-256 has the security of AES-128 against Grover).  
However, the results also highlight that the **quadratic speedup is not a silver bullet** ‚Äî it reduces key sizes needed, but doesn‚Äôt make brute force suddenly practical.

### 2. Shor‚Äôs Algorithm vs Classical Factoring

We implemented Shor‚Äôs algorithm to factor \(N=15\) and compared it against classical factoring.

- **Classical vs quantum sim runtimes:**  
  ![Shor N=15 classical vs quantum](reports/shor_classical_vs_quantum_N15.png)

- **Quantum elapsed time by base:**  
  ![Shor elapsed](reports/shor_quantum_elapsed_by_base.png)

- **Success rate by base:**  
  ![Shor success](reports/shor_success_by_base.png)

- **Asymptotic factoring cost (GNFS vs Shor):**  
  ![GNFS vs Shor](reports/shor_vs_gnfs_asymptotic.png)

**Explanation:**  
- For small composites like 15, **classical factoring is trivial**, while Shor‚Äôs algorithm suffers from simulator overhead.  
- Success varies depending on the chosen base; only some bases yield correct factors.  
- Asymptotically, Shor‚Äôs cubic cost \(O(k^3)\) is vastly better than GNFS‚Äôs sub-exponential complexity, which is why RSA will eventually be broken at scale.  
- The experiment demonstrates feasibility, not efficiency ‚Äî practical attacks need **millions of error-corrected qubits** [3].

### 3. Q# Resource Estimation

We used Microsoft Q#‚Äôs Resource Estimator to evaluate **T-counts, physical qubits, and runtimes** under different error models.

- **Grouped summary (T-count, qubits, runtime):**  
  ![Q# summary](reports/qsharp_clip_summary_all.png)

- **Detailed breakdown:**  
  ![Q# grouped](reports/qsharp_clip_summary_grouped.png)

**Explanation:**  
The results show:
- **T-counts** between ~90k and ~500k for modular exponentiation components.  
- **Physical qubits** range from thousands (optimistic) to hundreds of millions (conservative).  
- **Runtime estimates** span microseconds to seconds, depending on error budget.  

This demonstrates how **hardware assumptions dominate feasibility**: the math says Shor can break RSA, but the **engineering challenge of qubit counts and fidelity** keeps it out of reach ‚Äî for now.

### 4. Rose‚Äôs Law Projection

We projected qubit growth under different doubling assumptions and compared them against cryptographic breakpoints.

![Rose‚Äôs Law projection](reports/roses_law_from_timeline.png)

**Explanation:**  
- Breakpoints for cryptography:  
  - ~1M qubits for RSA-2048.  
  - ~10M qubits for ECC-256.  
- With optimistic growth (1000 starting qubits, doubling every 12 months), these thresholds could be hit in the **late 2030s**.  
- With slower growth (doubling every 24 months), the breakpoints shift to **post-2050**.  

This aligns with academic estimates that large-scale quantum attacks on RSA/ECC are a **mid-century concern** [3].

## üîπ Part II: PQC Side-Channel Analysis

While quantum attacks are a long-term threat, PQC is being deployed now. A critical question: **are implementations secure against side-channels like timing leakage?**

---

### 1. Experimental Setup
- Target: **Kyber KEM (Kyber-1024)**, implemented via liboqs.  
- Input classes:  
  - **clean** (valid ciphertexts).  
  - **flipped** (single-bit faulted ciphertexts).  
- Collected **20,000 decapsulation timings** per class using nanosecond-resolution timers.  

---

### 2. Timing Results

- **Boxplot (zoomed):**  
  ![Kyber boxplot](reports/kyber_timing_boxplot_zoom.png)

- **Histogram:**  
  ![Kyber histogram](reports/kyber_timing_hist.png)

- **Violin distribution:**  
  ![Kyber violin](reports/kyber_timing_violin.png)

---

### 3. Statistical Analysis

We compared clean vs flipped distributions.

- Clean mean = **12,756 ns**; flipped mean = **12,787 ns**.  
- Welch t-test: **p = 0.24** ‚Üí no significant mean difference.  
- Mann‚ÄìWhitney U: **p ‚âà 3e-65** ‚Üí distributions differ slightly in shape, but effect size negligible.  
- Cohen‚Äôs d = **‚Äì0.012** ‚Üí tiny/negligible.  
- Cliff‚Äôs delta = **0.057** ‚Üí tiny.  
- AUC ‚âà **0.45** ‚Üí classifier worse than random guessing.

Raw data: [`reports/kyber_clean.csv`](reports/kyber_clean.csv), [`reports/kyber_flip4.csv`](reports/kyber_flip4.csv)

---

### 4. Interpretation

- Earlier Kyber versions were vulnerable to **timing leakage during decapsulation** [1].  
- Patches introduced **constant-time rejection sampling** and **dummy secret substitution** [2].  
- Our lab confirms the **patched Kyber is constant-time**:  
  - No exploitable mean timing difference.  
  - Distributions overlap almost completely.  
  - Effect sizes are negligible.  

This demonstrates that PQC is not only resistant to quantum attacks in theory, but also hardened against **real-world side-channel threats**.

## üîπ Key Takeaways

- **Quantum threat:**  
  - Shor and Grover pose fundamental risks to RSA/ECC.  
  - Rose‚Äôs Law shows feasible timelines between 2035‚Äì2055 depending on hardware growth.  

- **PQC resilience:**  
  - Our timing experiments confirm Kyber resists known side-channel attacks.  
  - PQC adoption must consider **both algorithmic security and implementation security**.  

**Conclusion:**  
The ‚Äúdual threat‚Äù is clear: quantum computing threatens current crypto, while poor implementations could weaken PQC. Both must be addressed to secure the future.
